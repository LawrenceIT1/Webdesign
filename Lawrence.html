    </h1><b>The Vision of Worship in Heaven</b></h1>
    <p>I was caught up in a dream one night when I saw before me numerous Angels all dressed in purely white apparel and I heard them sing gloriously and melodiously harmonising their voices with one another. Each Angel was an instrument of music in himself, they had no earthly musical instruments but each Angel produced a different sound of musical instrument and they all harmonised their voices with the most glorious and melodious singing you can ever think of, I heard them all sing one chorus, ‘’HALLELUYAH~~~, HALLELUYAH~~~’’.</p> <br>
    <p>I looked and saw that they never get tired and their strength never diminished, they sung the same chorus day and night with great love and compassion and strength, they each loved and knew what they were doing. As they sung the sound of their voices appeared like pure white smoke which went from their parades and ascended to the throne of God.</p><br><br>
    <p>I was utterly amazed by how worship is done in heaven as compared on earth where people sing of the things they don’t know about, even some don’t know the name of the God they sing to, I saw a choir performing praise and worship totally in flesh as if they had been forced to do so, and immediately when they left the platform, one by one they begun to doze off while the preacher begun to speak. How I wish people get to understand the name of the God they are serving, they would make perfect selection of songs to use during a worship service.</p><br>
    <p>There is a song which when sung during a worship service welcomes demons and devils into the church and quenches away the spirit of God but most times the children of God don’t realize the difference, they just love to entertain and to be entertained by the music. The glory of God has left the church and the devil has baptised people with familiar spirits which perform miracles and signs.</p><br>
    <p>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 24: God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. <link rel="stylesheet" value="John-4-23_4-24" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-4-23_4-24/">(John4:23-24)</p><br>
    <P>If we ever want to worship God in truth and spirit, then we ought to dwell in His eternal word. The Angels in heaven worship God making mention of His eternal attributes and singing about His eternal Glorious Name.</P><br>
    <P text-align="centre">"Before you worship Him, first fall in love with him"</P><br>
    <p>The Seraphims in Isaiah 6; worship saying; Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Host. The Living Creatures in Revelations 4 worship saying; Holy Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. All the saints in heaven worship in Revalations19:1 saying; Alleluia, salvation, and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God. As they worship, they bow down and kneel down before the king of glory (Psalms 95:6).</p><br>
    <p>Let’s all as the children of the most high God join the choir of the saints in heaven and of the Angels and worship God singing about His eternal attributes and His Glorious Eternal Name in total submission and humility.</p><br>
